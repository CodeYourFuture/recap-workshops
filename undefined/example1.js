let a = 8;

console.log(a);


// The output of the example code console.log(a); will be undefined.

// This is because the variable a has been declared but not assigned any value. In JavaScript, when a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value is undefined. So, when you log the value of a to the console, you will see undefined printed.

// If you want to avoid seeing undefined in your code, you can initialize your variables with a default value when you declare them. For example, you could write let a = null; or let a = 0; depending on what makes sense for your use case.
