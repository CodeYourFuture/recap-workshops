// The output in the example below contains undefined because letters is an array with three elements, indexed from 0 to 2. When you try to access the element at index 3 (arr[3]), which is beyond the last index of the letters array, JavaScript returns undefined because there is no value at that index.The output in the example below contains undefined because letters is an array with three elements, indexed from 0 to 2.
