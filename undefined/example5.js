let car = {
    wheels: 4,

}

console.log(car.colour);


// // The output in the example below contains undefined because the car object does not have a colour property defined. When you attempt to access a property that does not exist in an object, the value returned is undefined.

// In this example, the car object has two properties defined: wheels and doors, but it does not have a colour property. When you attempt to access the colour property of the car object using car.colour, the value returned is undefined because the colour property does not exist in the object.

// To avoid getting undefined when accessing an object's properties, you need to make sure that the properties you are trying to access are defined in the object.
