Q: What is the difference between `let` and `const`?

A: `const` is a signal that the identifier won't be reassigned. `let` is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it's defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.
